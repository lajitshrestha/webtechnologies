        Since 1982, Clash has never stopped evolving. From the first Clash arcade game, to the hit racing game Clash
        Dash, and even to its darkest point in history with Clash: Cradle of Darkness, the village building game we know
        and love today has taken many different forms.

        Whether you're beating a high score at the arcade, or joining your clanmates in a raid, Clash has always offered
        user-friendly & fun experiences for gamers.
